I've been craving for your love
Can't see nobody but us (can't see nobody but us)
So I, so I, so I
See you from across the room
Make my way over to you (my way over to you)
I'm trippin' over butterflies
Moonlight sunrise
Baby, come be my starlight
Moonlight sunrise
Oh, baby, just to make you stay
Moonlight sunrise
Baby, let's do it all night
Moonlight sunrise
I guarantee I got ya
Moonlight sunrise
Moonlight sunrise (oh, baby, just to make you stay)
Moonlight sunrise
Moonlight sunrise (I guarantee I got ya)
Moonlight sunrise
Moonlight sunrise (oh, baby, just to make you stay)
Moonlight sunrise
Moonlight sunrise (I guarantee I got ya)
Moonlight sunrise
Baby, come be my starlight
Moonlight sunrise
Baby, come be my starlight, starlight
Moonlight sunrise
Baby, come be my starlight
Moonlight sunrise
Moonlight sunrise
(Hoo) took a trip under moonlight
Follow me to the sunrise
Everyday, every night
Ayy, come with me, don't think twice
I don't know how to say this
I hope this song's on your playlist
This feeling's so hard to explain
I don't even know how to talk right now
It's "I need you" o'clock right now
I want you to hear me say
Moonlight sunrise
Baby, come be my starlight
Moonlight sunrise
Oh, baby, just to make you stay
Moonlight sunrise
Baby, let's do it all night
Moonlight sunrise
I guarantee I got ya
Moonlight sunrise
Moonlight sunrise (oh, baby, just to make you stay)
Moonlight sunrise
Moonlight sunrise (I guarantee I got ya)
Moonlight sunrise
Moonlight sunrise (oh, baby, just to make you stay)
Moonlight sunrise
Moonlight sunrise (I guarantee I got ya)
Moonlight sunrise
Baby, come be my starlight
Moonlight sunrise
Baby, come be my starlight, starlight
Moonlight sunrise
Baby, come be my starlight
Moonlight sunrise
Moonlight sunrise
