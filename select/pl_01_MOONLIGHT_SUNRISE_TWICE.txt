Oh yeah
I guarantee I gotcha
I've been craving for your love
Can't see nobody but us
So I so I so I
See you from across the room
Make my way over to you
I'm trippin' over butterflies
Oh yeah baby
I don't really mean to rush
but Imma really need your touch
If Imma make it thru the night
I got the moonlight
Tequila sunrise
Come take a shot on me
I gotcha
I don't know how to say this
I hope this song is on your
playlist
this feelings so hard to explain
I don't even know
how to talk right now
it's I need you o'clock right
now
I want you to hear me say
Moonlight Sunrise
baby come be my starlight
Moonlight Sunrise
(Oh baby Just to make you stay)
Moonlight Sunrise
baby let's do it all night
Moonlight Sunrise
I guarantee I gotcha
Loving undefeated
on your knees pleading
baby U can hit up my line
when you need it
said that you tried
baby you succeeded
Got a craving baby
Can U feed it
Took a trip under moonlight
Follow me to the sunrise
everyday everynight
Ayyyy, come with me don't
think twice
Oh yeah baby
I don't really mean to rush
but Imma really need your touch
If Imma make it thru the night
I got the moonlight
Tequila sunrise
Come take a shot on me
I gotcha
I don't know how to say this
I hope this song is on your
playlist
this feelings so hard to explain
I don't even know
how to talk right now
it's I need you o'clock right
now
I want you to hear me say
Moonlight Sunrise

Moonlight Sunrise
(Oh baby Just to make you stay)
Moonlight Sunrise
